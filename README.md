1. A virtual environment is necessary when working with Python projects to ensure each project's dependencies are kept separate from each other. You need to create your virtual environment, also called a venv, and then ensure that it is activated any time you return to your workspace.
Click the gear icon in the lower left-hand corner of the screen to open the Manage menu and select **Command Palette** to open the VS Code command palette.

1. In the command palette, type: *create environment* and select **Python: Create Environment…**

1. Choose **Venv** from the dropdown list.

1. Choose the Python version you installed earlier. Currently, we recommend Python 3.12.8

1. **DO NOT** click the box next to `requirements.txt`, as you need to do more steps before you can install your dependencies. Click **OK**.

1. You will see a `.venv` folder appear in the file explorer pane to show that the virtual environment has been created.

1. **Important**: Note that the `.venv` folder is in the `.gitignore` file so that Git won't track it.

1. Return to the terminal by clicking on the TERMINAL tab, or click on the **Terminal** menu and choose **New Terminal** if no terminal is currently open.

1. In the terminal, use the command below to install your dependencies. This may take several minutes.

 ```console
 pip3 install -r requirements.txt
 ```

1. Open the `jupyter_notebooks` directory, and click on the notebook you want to open.

1. Click the **kernel** button and choose **Python Environments**.

Note that the kernel says `Python 3.12.8` as it inherits from the venv, so it will be Python-3.12.8 if that is what is installed on your PC. To confirm this, you can use the command below in a notebook code cell.

```console
! python --version
```

## Deployment Reminders

* Set the `.python-version` Python version to a [Heroku-22](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-support#supported-runtimes) stack currently supported version that closest matches what you used in this project.
* The project can be deployed to Heroku using the following steps.

1. Log in to Heroku and create an App
2. At the **Deploy** tab, select **GitHub** as the deployment method.
3. Select your repository name and click **Search**. Once it is found, click **Connect**.
4. Select the branch you want to deploy, then click **Deploy Branch**.
5. The deployment process should happen smoothly if all deployment files are fully functional. Click the button **Open App** at the top of the page to access your App.
6. If the slug size is too large, then add large files not required for the app to the `.slugignore` file.

# Capstone Project: OULAD Student Performance Analysis

# **Project Overview**

This project analyses the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD) to understand how student demographics, engagement behaviour, and assessment performance relate to final outcomes. 

The goal is to produce clear, actionable insights supported by statistical analysis, reproducible Python workflows, and an executive-ready dashboard built in Power BI/Tableau.

This work was completed as part of a 5 day data analytics capstone, demonstrating end to end analytics capability: data cleaning, feature engineering, EDA, statistical testing, visualisation, and communication.

# **Business Problem Statement / Requirements**

The Open University wishes to improve student retention and academic performance by understanding the drivers of success and what leads to students failing or withdrawing. This project analyses demographic,, engagement, and assessment data to identify early indicators of risk (i.e. students fail or withdraw) and provide actionable insights for early student intervention measures.

# **Key Business Question:**

1. What factors most strongly predict whether a student will succeed (pass or get a distinciton) or fail (fail or withdraw)
2. How can we identify at-risk students early?

# **Dataset:**

The Open University Analytics Dataset (OULAD) is a widely used , openly available dataset designed for research in learning analytics, student performance prediction and educational data mining. 

It was released by the Open University (UK) and contains anonymised data about students, courses and their interactions with the university's Virtual learning Environment (VLE). 

About 20 years ago I undertook two statistics courses with the Open University and so my familiarity with the learning environment led me to choose this dataset.

The dataset can be downloaded from here:

## **Hypotheses to Test and how to validate them**

Engagement Hypothesis:
Ho: There is no difference in total VLE engagement between students who pass and those who fail/withdraw.
H1: Students who pass have significantly higher engagement than those who fail/withdraw.
Region Hypothesis (Anova):
Ho: Average assessment scores do not differ across regions
H1: Average assessment scores differ by region.
Gender Hypothesis (Chi-Square)??
Ho: Gender is independent of the final result
H1: Gender is associated with the final result.
Lateness Hypothesis
Ho: Submission lateness is independent of the final result
H1: Submission lateness is associated with the final result.
Registration Timing Hypothesis
Ho: Registration date does not impact the final result
H1: Late registration increased the likelihood of failing or withdrawing.
Your Final Hypothesis Framework (Portfolio Ready)
Cluster	Hypothesis	Test	Variables
Engagement Volume	Passers have higher total clicks	Mann–Whitney U	total_clicks × final_result
Engagement Consistency	Passers access VLE on more days	Mann–Whitney U	vle_days_accessed × final_result
Engagement Intensity	Passers have higher avg clicks/day	Mann–Whitney U	avg_clicks × final_result
Demographics	Final result differs by highest education	Chi square	highest_education × final_result
Prior Attempts	More previous attempts → lower pass rate	Mann–Whitney U	num_of_prev_attempts × final_result

# The use of geneartive AI tools to help with ideation, design htinking and code optimisaiton

# **Ethical Considerations**

OULAD is an openly available and anonymised dataset. However, even here there may potentially be ethical considerations should as:

1. Privacy and aonymisation limits: there is a risk of re-identifation should external data sources be included or where subgroups are so small that re-identification is feasible   

2. Fairness and bias: Risk that the database might under or over-represent certain demogrphics leading to inequalities (e.g. socioeconomic status, disability, gender ) that are then amplified though analysis

3. Responsbile USe: Any analysis does not harm or disadvantage students

4. Interpretability: Complex models e.g. RandomForest can lack transparency and so any predictions may need to be verified using alternative algorithms

5. Data Context: OULAD is the dataset from the Open University and any conclusions and recommendations derived may not be transferable to other contexts/institutions

6. Respect for students: The OULAD dataset represents real students not simply data points. Hence any conclusions or recommendations derived from this dataset should actively seek to support students, treating them in an ethical manner, and not penalise them.

## **Dashboards**
List all dashboard pages and their content, either blocks of information or widgets, like buttons, checkboxes, images, or any other item that your dashboard library supports.
Later, during the project development, you may revisit your dashboard plan to update a given feature (for example, at the beginning of the project you were confident you would use a given plot to display an insight but subsequently you used another plot type).
How were data insights communicated to technical and non-technical audiences?
Explain how the dashboard was designed to communicate complex data insights to different audiences.

## **Student Demographics**

**Overview: The OU student population shows a higher likelihood of students being male, residing in England, having a secondary level education, belonging to lower socio-economic bands, being younger in age and not reporting a disability.**

![alt text](image.png)

## Success can be measured via:

-  final result: (Pass, Distinction, Fail & Withdrawn)
-  ongoing assessments: Computer Marked Assessments (CMA), Tutor MArked Assessments (TMA) and Exam
-  engagement levels

## **Student Final Result (Pass = Success; At Risk = Fail/Withdrawn)**

**Overview: The OU student population shows success is most likely from those with post-graduate qualifications, higher socio economic groups and older or middle aged students.**

![alt text](image-5.png)

## ** Assessment Type**

## ** Overview: CMAs have the lowest weighting relative to the final result but produce the highest average scores, whereas TMAs and Exams have higher weights but lower average scores**
